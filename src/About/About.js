      <h1 className="aboutH1">Misadhi's Story</h1>
        <p className="aboutP1">Misadhi Coffee Society began operations in the late 1950s. For decades it provided a solid 
        base for the coffee farmers in the Rongo area of Migori County, Kenya. But eventually corruption took hold and the
         Society was closed. It remained closed for nearly thirty years. But in 2022 it was reopened and is now thriving 
         again under new management.</p>
        <p className="aboutP2">In Kenya the dominate way of doing business is with Societies. A similar word would be Coops.
          These societies are run by the farmers who own them. Many times, these Boards are comprised of just small-scale 
          farmers. Almost always, they have no training or capitol to grow this business. Investors are not allowed to own 
          or have an ownership interest in the Society by Kenya law. So many of them fade into oblivion, others close due to
           corruption. (The board takes off with all the money) And a few are actually successful. There are some, but there
            are usually problems, and all have a certain amount of risk. These Societies never pay on delivery, but the
             successful ones do eventually pay, and have a good reputation for paying, and those are successful in their own
              way.</p>
       <p className="aboutP3">George Yost came to Misadhi in 2021 and that resulted in an investment of several 
              hundreds of thousands of USD to reopen the mill and build a farmer network of members. The concept of Societies
               was good at a time, but it is not realistic to take in a Million KG of cherry without paying anyone for 6 
               months. This business practice has led to many farmers choosing to do business with Misadhi. We will processed
                over 1 Million tG of Cherry each year for 2022, and 2023. </p>
        <p className="aboutP4">When Misadhi was reopened in 2022, I Million Kg was the goal. And so far we are right on 
        target with these goals. The finances have largely been taken from the board, and the responsibility of farm 
        outreach programs have taken their place. Our Board is focused solely on developing nurseries, producing through 
        a generous profit-sharing program. So the Boards only focus is in increasing yields, quality, and tree count in 
        the four counties in which Misadhi operates. </p>
        <p className="aboutP5">Misadhi operates over 50 weighing stations. This shortens the distance for each of our Farmer
         Member to bring their cherry to the mill. We operate 6 pickup trucks to transport cherry to the mill. The small
          open-air trucks increase the quality of cherry to the mill. Over Ripe cherry is a thing of the past. This results
           in much fresher cherry and a better cup of coffee.</p>
        <p className="aboutP6">Each station is equipped with a digital scale. Each farmer’s weight is recorded on the day 
        or days that station is opened, and that farmer is paid within 24 hours of them bringing their cherry to the weigh
         station.</p> 
        <p className="aboutP7">This should not be taken for granted. Societies traditionally pay for the cherry anywhere 
        from 4 months to 12 months and sometimes, way too often, never. No less than 8 Societies in our four-county area
         have been closed in the past year because they failed to pay for last year’s cherry. The theory is the farmers will
          share in the profits when the coffee actually sells to an international buyer. But mainly farmers prefer to get a 
          fair price for their cherry and get paid right away. Much the same they do for all other things they sell. Maize, 
          Livestock, Beans, Fruits. All are sold to local markets and the farmer receives immediate payment in full. 
          At Misadhi we pay this way because it is what the farmers want.</p> 
        <p className="aboutP8">A typical day in the Kawaha Season is this: The weigh station opens at about 9 AM. Farmers start 
        to bring in their cherry. We send a truck there at 11 AM and again at 2 PM and a final pickup after 3 PM. We supply bags,
         and scales, batteries, tarps, and everything they need to run the weigh station. When the cherry reaches the mill,
          (About an hour away) we unload and we start picking the green and over ripe cherries out of the mix. 
          Then that fresh red cherry is milled. And all cherries are pulped and in fermentation 12 hours off being picked.</p>
        <p className="aboutP9">By morning, this crew all go home, and our drying crew comes to work. These people spread
         the newly fermented wet processed parchment on raised drying beds. They also continually stir all the parchment 
         that is drying. Our drying yard is about is about 5 acres. Raised beds is the BEST way to dry coffee. We slow dry
          for 21 days. We cover the parchment on hot days to slow it down. We want to take a full 21 days for drying. This 
          brings out the best of the sugars and gives our coffee it full flavors. We have 3 moisture readers so no guesswork
           on the moisture content. We dry to 10.5% then we pick it up and store it in one of our stores. </p>
        <p className="aboutP10">Our Dry Mill is about 20 KL from the Wet Mill. So dry parchment is taken to the dry mill 
        for hulling and grading. After this is done, we bring the green coffee back to the Misadhi mill where it will be 
        hand picked to remove any blacks, insect damaged, or deformed beans. This process provides jobs for people who 
        desperately need them and it assures all our customers they will get the very best West 
        Kenya coffee that there is.</p>
        <p className="aboutP11">Our process gives over 1,100 farmers money they need to send their kids to school, and 
        even the money they need to feed their kids. We hear this every day how happy they are to get paid right away. 
        When we first started, we heard about all the farmers who destroyed their coffee trees and changed to sugar cane. 
        Now that there is a viable market for their coffee, we get asked how can I get into the coffee business? An of course
         we help them to do that.</p>
        <p className="aboutP12">By the end of 2023, we will have 4 nurseries operating. We gave away 20,000 trees in 2023.
         In the next 2 years that number will be 100,000 plus per year. What the farmers need most is help growing the 
         coffee. The average yield per tree is only 3 KG per tree per year. That can easily go to 20 with a few changes.
          Compost is the most important item. We have community compost piles. Anyone who puts in time can get compost for
           free. We also provide free beans or Ground Nuts to plant with their trees. Beans replace Nitrogen in the soil.
            It is very good for intercrop with coffee. And it gives each farmer another income. There are many more advanced
             projects but most of our farmers are at the beginning, they are not advanced. 
             But this will change over time.</p>
        <p className="aboutP13">Misadhi’s goal is a completely sustainable Society. We provide a market for their cherry.
         We help them to grow more cherry, and this becomes the most profitable cash crop they can participate in. 
         The sustainability runs full circle. We will be planting Yellow Bourbon next year, and a lot more SL 28.</p>
        <p className="aboutP14">We have come a long way in two years. </p>
