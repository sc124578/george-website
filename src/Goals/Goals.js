                    weigh station.</li>
                    <li className="goalsLi">In Kenya, it was common for Societies to delay payment till after the coffee 
                    is sold. Timeline of 6 months PLUS. This practice led farmers to leave the coffee sector.</li>
                    <li className="goalsLi">With Farm input support, fair prices, and timely payments we are seeing an 
                    increase in farmers planting coffee trees. (which we provide for free)</li>
                    <li className="goalsLi">The main reason for farmers to leave coffee farming is uncertainty of selling 
                    their cherry, and getting a fair price they can count on.</li>

                <p className="goalsp3">We manage about 50 Stations. This cuts down on the travel time for each farmer who 
                brings their cherry to us. Farmers come on foot, bicycles, motor bikes. Any way possible. Reduced distance 
                is a big help. We pay them the same day, and we weigh each bag, and track each contribution. This helps to 
                determine the amount of assistance we can offer each farmer.</p>

                We also manage each batch. We slow the drying. We donâ€™t want any batch to take less than three weeks to dry. 
                Sometimes longer depending on weather.
                We actually know when each batch is added to the drying yard. We slow the process by 
                not exposing it to the sun more than 4 hours per day, Slow is always better!</p>

                superior to many. All beans are graded by size and also density. P1, is the highest density, but even those 
                are also sorted again by density. 
                That is why Kenya coffee is the best in the world. We really know how to process 
                coffee.</p>

                We give these trees away free of charge to members. We also provide tools that 
                farmers can borrow, as well as training on things such as compost, and organic fertilizer, proper 
                pruning.
